# MALL - Maple Agent Learning Lab

The Maple Agent Learning Lab (MALL) is the distributed learning infrastructure for the MAPLE AI framework. It provides continuous evolution, optimization, and adaptation capabilities for cognitive agents through federated learning, reinforcement learning, and auto-spawning intelligence.

## Key Features

### 1. **Federated Learning**
- Privacy-preserving distributed training across nodes
- Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) for model aggregation
- Support for various aggregation strategies (FedAvg, weighted averaging, etc.)
- Differential privacy with configurable privacy budgets

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning**
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation with dueling architecture
- Experience replay buffer for stable training
- Support for double DQN and other advanced techniques
- Real-time policy updates with configurable learning rates

### 3. **Auto-Spawn Intelligence**
- LSTM-based prediction of system load and agent requirements
- Multiple spawning strategies (reactive, predictive, scheduled, adaptive)
- Template-based agent creation with predefined configurations
- Dynamic scaling based on environmental conditions

### 4. **Strategy Generation**
- GAN-based novel strategy synthesis
- Holographic compression for efficient strategy sharing
- Strategy interpolation and evaluation capabilities

### 5. **Privacy & Security**
- Differential privacy for model updates
- Homomorphic encryption support (simulated)
- Secure aggregation protocols
- Message encryption for communication
