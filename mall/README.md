## Quick Start

### Starting the MALL Server

```python
# Run the MALL server
python -m mall.server.mall_server
```

### Using the MALL Client
```python
from mall.client import MALLClient, MALLClientConfig
from mall.models.agent_model import AgentModel, ModelType
from mall.spawn.auto_spawner import SpawnRequest

# Create client
config = MALLClientConfig(base_url="http://localhost:8080")
client = MALLClient(config)
await client.connect()

# Train an agent
model = AgentModel(
    model_id="my-agent",
    model_type=ModelType.DQN,
    input_size=10,
    output_size=4
)

round_id = await client.train_federated(
    model=model,
    task_type="navigation",
    config={"epochs": 10, "learning_rate": 0.001}
)

# Monitor training
status = await client.wait_for_training(round_id)
print(f"Training completed: {status}")

# Spawn new agent based on predictions
env_data = await client.sense_environment("default")
spawn_prediction = await client.predict_spawn_need(env_data, "logistics")

if spawn_prediction["should_spawn"]:
    spawn_req = SpawnRequest(
        agent_id="worker-001",
        template_name="logistics",
        capabilities=["transport", "optimize"],
        configuration={"max_load": 100}
    )
    agent_id = await client.spawn_agent(spawn_req)
    print(f"Spawned agent: {agent_id}")
```

### Implementing Custom Learning

```python
from mall.core.learning_node import LearningNode, NodeConfig
from mall.core.federated import FederatedLearningManager

# Create learning node
node_config = NodeConfig(
    node_id="custom-node",
    shard_id="research",
    max_concurrent_training=5
)
node = LearningNode(node_config)
await node.start()

# Register with federated manager
fed_manager = FederatedLearningManager(FederatedConfig())
await fed_manager.register_node(node, {"research", "analysis"})

# Start federated round
round_id = await fed_manager.start_federated_round(
   model_id="research-model",
   model=my_model,
   task_type="analysis",
   config={"dataset": my_dataset}
)

# Wait for aggregation
await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Let training complete
aggregated_model = await fed_manager.aggregate_round(round_id)

```
## Integration with MAPLE Components

### 1. Integration with ARS (Agent Registry Service)
MALL integrates with ARS for agent lifecycle management:
```python
# When spawning an agent, MALL generates UAL command
spawn_request = SpawnRequest(
    agent_id="new-agent",
    template_name="worker",
    capabilities=["compute", "analyze"]
)

# This generates UAL command that ARS processes
ual_command = spawn_request.to_ual_command()
# SPAWN new-agent FROM worker {
#     capabilities: ["compute", "analyze"],
#     config: {...}
# }

# ARS registers the agent with DID and tracks its state

```

### 2. Integration with UAL (Universal Agent Language)
MALL uses UAL commands for agent operations:

```python
# MALL senses environment using UAL SNS verb
SNS environment WITH {
    metrics: ["cpu", "memory", "tasks"],
    interval: 10
}

# MALL triggers evolution using UAL EVOLVE construct
EVOLVE agent_model WITH {
    strategy: "reinforcement",
    reward_function: "efficiency"
}
```

### 3. Integration with MAP (Multi-Agent Protocol)
MALL uses MAP for distributing models and strategies:

```python
# Compress model for holographic transfer
holographic_model = model.to_holographic()

# Send via MAP
message = Message(
    type=MessageType.MODEL_UPDATE,
    payload=holographic_model,
    destination=AgentDestination(broadcast=True)
)
await map_client.send(message)
```

### 4. Integration with SDK/API
The SDK provides unified access to MALL features:

```python
from maple import MAPLEClient

# Initialize MAPLE client
maple = MAPLEClient(api_key="your-key")

# Access MALL features through unified interface
mall = maple.learning

# Train agents
await mall.train_agent("agent-1", training_config)

# Monitor learning metrics
metrics = await mall.get_metrics()
```

## Advanced Features
### 1. Emergent Behavior Simulation
MALL simulates emergent consciousness through graph neural networks:

```python
# Model agent interactions as GNN
interaction_graph = build_agent_interaction_graph(agents)
emergent_patterns = gnn_model(interaction_graph)

# Identify collective behaviors
swarm_coordination = detect_swarm_patterns(emergent_patterns)
```
### 2. Quantum-Inspired Optimization
Experimental quantum algorithms for strategy optimization:

```python
# Quantum annealing simulation for complex optimization
from mall.strategies.quantum import QuantumOptimizer

optimizer = QuantumOptimizer()
optimal_strategy = optimizer.anneal(
    problem_space=strategy_space,
    temperature_schedule=exponential_decay
)
```
### 3. Transfer Learning Across Shards
Share learned models between different environments:

```python
# Export model as holographic payload
holo_payload = await mall.export_holographic(model)

# Transfer to different shard
await mall.import_holographic(
    payload=holo_payload,
    target_shard="production"
)
```

### 4. Self-Modifying Behaviors
Agents can propose and evaluate new behaviors:

```python
# Agent proposes new behavior
PROPOSE BEHAVIOR efficient_routing {
    ON task_received(task) {
        route = optimize_path(task.destination)
        EXECUTE transport WITH route
    }
}

# MALL evaluates using GAN fitness function
fitness_score = strategy_gan.evaluate(proposed_behavior)
if fitness_score > threshold:
    await mall.adopt_behavior(agent_id, proposed_behavior)
```

```

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues

1. Training Timeout

* Check network connectivity between nodes
* Verify sufficient resources on learning nodes
* Adjust aggregation_timeout in config


2. Spawn Prediction Errors

3. Privacy Budget Exceeded

* Monitor epsilon consumption with /metrics/privacy
* Adjust noise_multiplier or reduce training frequency
* Consider increasing privacy budget if appropriate


### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for detailed diagnostics:
```python
# Set environment variable
export MALL_DEBUG=true

# Or in code
mall_client = MALLClient(config, debug=True)
```
