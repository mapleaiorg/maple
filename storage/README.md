# Storage Ops Assets

This root-level folder is reserved for storage **operational assets**, not Rust library code.

Examples:

- SQL migration bundles
- database bootstrap scripts
- local Docker compose profiles for storage dependencies
- fixture snapshots for integration environments

Runtime abstractions and adapters live in `crates/maple/storage`.
