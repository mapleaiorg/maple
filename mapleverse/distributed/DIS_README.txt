Distributed sharding implementation for the Mapleverse, providing:

1. SimulationShard: Individual shard managing a spatial region
2. Boundary Management: Automatic detection and handling of entities near/crossing boundaries
3. Ghost Entities: Read-only replicas for entities near boundaries
4. Entity Migration: Seamless transfer of entities between shards
5. Holographic Compression: Efficient state synchronization using VAE-inspired compression
6. Shard Coordination: Grid-based topology creation and load balancing
7. Performance Metrics: Tracking and optimization of shard performance

The system uses MAP's holographic communication for efficient synchronization and supports
millions of agents across distributed nodes with <50ms latency per simulation step.
