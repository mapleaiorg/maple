Comprehensive MAPLE AI Agent Service implementation.

The service provides:

1. Core Agent Architecture: Modular design with dynamic model selection, LLM/AGI adapters, and response aggregation
2. Multiple LLM Support: Adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models with easy extensibility
3. Intelligent Model Selection: Context-aware selection using reinforcement learning
4. Response Aggregation: Weighted averaging and majority voting strategies
5. Performance Optimization: Response caching, monitoring, and metrics collection
6. MAPLE Integration: Seamless integration with MAP, UAL, ARS, MALL, and Mapleverse
7. Production Ready: HTTP/gRPC server, configuration management, and deployment tools
8. Developer Tools: CLI, testing utilities, and benchmarking capabilities

The AI Agent Service is now ready to enable MAPLE agents to leverage multiple LLMs and AGIs
for complex cognitive tasks while maintaining the framework's core principles of scalability,
interoperability, and intelligence.
