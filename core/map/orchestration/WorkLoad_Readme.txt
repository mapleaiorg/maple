MAP Workflow Orchestration Engine:

Core Models (core/map/orchestration/models.py)

Workflow and step states
Execution contexts with variable management
Retry policies and compensation strategies
Comprehensive metrics tracking


Step Implementations (core/map/orchestration/steps.py)

MessageStep: Send messages to agents
ParallelStep: Execute multiple steps concurrently
ConditionalStep: Conditional execution based on expressions
LoopStep: Iterate over collections with concurrency control
SubWorkflowStep: Execute nested workflows
WaitStep: Wait for duration or condition
TransformStep: Data transformation with Jinja2 templates
AggregateStep: Aggregate results from multiple steps
CustomStep: Extensible custom logic


Core Engine (core/map/orchestration/engine.py)

WorkflowInstance: Runtime execution with pause/resume/cancel
WorkflowEngine: Main orchestration engine
Event-driven architecture with handlers
Comprehensive error handling and compensation
Background task management


Persistence Layer (core/map/orchestration/persistence.py)

InMemoryPersistence: For development/testing
RedisPersistence: For distributed deployments
PostgresPersistence: For production use
CompositePersistence: Multi-tier persistence strategy
Checkpoint support for long-running workflows


Builder and DSL (core/map/orchestration/builder.py)

Fluent API for programmatic workflow creation
YAML/JSON DSL support
Pre-built workflow patterns (ETL, ML pipeline, approval flows)
Workflow validation
Reusable pattern library (circuit breaker, saga, fan-out/fan-in)



Key Features Implemented:

Execution Control

Pause/resume capabilities
Graceful cancellation
Timeout management
Progress tracking


Error Handling

Configurable retry strategies
Compensation/rollback support
Circuit breaker pattern
Detailed error tracking


Scalability

Concurrent step execution
Rate limiting support
