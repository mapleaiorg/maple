Complete message structure with headers, payloads, and security
Support for various message types and delivery modes
Flexible routing destinations


Routing Engine (core/map/routing/engine.py)

Intelligent agent selection based on capabilities and performance
Load balancing and health monitoring
Service discovery and capability indexing


Transport Layer (core/map/transport/base.py)

Multiple transport protocols (HTTP, WebSocket)
Delivery guarantees implementation
Connection management and retries


Workflow Orchestration (core/map/orchestration/workflow.py)

Complex workflow execution with parallel, conditional, and loop steps
Compensation/rollback capabilities
State management and persistence


Protocol Server (core/map/server/protocol_server.py)

Main server implementation with all HTTP endpoints
WebSocket support for real-time communication
Kafka integration for clustering
Comprehensive monitoring and metrics


Security Layer (core/map/security/auth.py)

JWT-based authentication
Role-based access control (RBAC)
Message encryption and signing
API key management


Middleware (core/map/middleware/auth_middleware.py)

Authentication and authorization middleware
Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
Audit logging for security events
Message validation


Main Entry Point (core/map/__main__.py)

CLI interface with configuration management
Docker support for containerized deployment
Demo data initialization
Production-ready setup



Key Features Implemented:

Scalability: Horizontal scaling support with Kafka clustering
Security: Comprehensive authentication, authorization, and encryption
Reliability: Circuit breakers, retries, and fault tolerance
Monitoring: Prometheus metrics and health checks
Flexibility: Multiple transport protocols and message patterns
Developer Experience: Clean APIs and comprehensive error handling

The MAP protocol is now ready to handle planetary-scale agent communication with high reliability and security.
